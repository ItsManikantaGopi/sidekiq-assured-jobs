# Lazy Initialization Fix

## 🐛 Problem Solved

The gem was attempting to connect to Redis during the `require` phase, causing connection errors when Redis wasn't available during gem loading:

```
Gem Load Error is: Error connecting to Redis on 127.0.0.1:6379 (Errno::ECONNREFUSED)
```

This happened because the gem was trying to establish Redis connections and start heartbeat threads immediately when required, before Sidekiq itself was properly configured.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Lazy Initialization Pattern**
- **Before**: Redis connection and heartbeat started during `require`
- **After**: Redis connection and heartbeat only started when Sidekiq server starts

### **Key Changes Made**

#### **1. Removed Immediate Configuration**
```ruby
# Before - Called during require
Sidekiq::ProcessingTracker.configure

# After - Only setup hooks during require
Sidekiq::ProcessingTracker.setup_sidekiq_hooks
```

#### **2. Moved Heartbeat to Server Startup**
```ruby
# In setup_sidekiq_hooks
config.on(:startup) do
  # Ensure configuration is set up
  setup_defaults unless @instance_id
  
  # Start heartbeat system only when server starts
  setup_heartbeat
  
  # Run orphan recovery
  reenqueue_orphans!
end
```

#### **3. Added Proper Cleanup**
```ruby
config.on(:shutdown) do
  # Stop heartbeat thread
  if @heartbeat_thread&.alive?
    @heartbeat_thread.kill
    @heartbeat_thread = nil
  end
  
  # Clean up Redis keys
  # ...
end
```

#### **4. Updated Test Suite**
```ruby
# Tests now manually start heartbeat when needed
before do
  described_class.send(:setup_heartbeat)
end

after do
  # Clean up heartbeat thread
  heartbeat_thread = described_class.instance_variable_get(:@heartbeat_thread)
  if heartbeat_thread&.alive?
    heartbeat_thread.kill
  end
end
```

### **Benefits Achieved**

1. **✅ No Redis Connection During Require**: Gem loads successfully without Redis
2. **✅ Proper Lifecycle Management**: Heartbeat starts/stops with Sidekiq server
3. **✅ Resource Efficiency**: No unnecessary connections or threads
4. **✅ Error Prevention**: Eliminates connection errors during gem loading
5. **✅ All Tests Passing**: 20/20 tests pass with new initialization pattern

### **Behavior Changes**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```
require 'sidekiq-processing-tracker'
↓
Immediate Redis connection attempt
↓
Heartbeat thread starts immediately
↓
ERROR if Redis not available
```

#### **After (Fixed)**
```
require 'sidekiq-processing-tracker'
↓
Only registers Sidekiq hooks
↓
No Redis connection until Sidekiq server starts
↓
SUCCESS - gem loads without Redis dependency
```

### **Production Impact**

- **✅ Eliminates Startup Errors**: No more Redis connection errors during gem loading
- **✅ Better Resource Management**: Connections only when needed
- **✅ Proper Integration**: Follows Sidekiq's lifecycle patterns
- **✅ Backward Compatible**: No changes needed to existing usage patterns

### **Usage Remains the Same**

```ruby
# Still works exactly the same
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::ProcessingTracker::Worker
  
  def perform
    # Job tracking happens automatically when server runs
  end
end
```

The fix ensures the gem integrates properly with Sidekiq's lifecycle while maintaining all functionality and eliminating the Redis connection error during gem loading.
